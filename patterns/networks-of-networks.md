# Network of Networks (working title)

## The Design Problem

In a decentralized social network, people can "follow" friends who use a different server. This often requires users to initiate a "follow" action on the other server for each friend, and requires the recipient, not the sharer, to initiate the connection.

## The Design Solution

When a user shares a post with someone on another server, they can initiate the process by granting access to their friend's phone number or e-mail address. The recipient can be notified with an e-mail or text message, and the recipient can change the settings to disable subsequent notifications from that server.

Users can identify themselves to another server one-time, by validating an e-mail address or phone number. When that identity is allowed to access posts, they will appear in the feed.

Examples

        • Airfeed.ai
        • Photo.gy

## Why Choose Network of Networks?

        • When you want to give users a low-friction means of reaching friends on other servers.

## Best Practices: How to Implement Network of Networks?

        • Allow users to use their friend's contact information to control access to posts.

## Potential Problems with Network of Networks?

        • Users who lose access to a phone number or e-mail address will lose access to posts

## The Take-Away

Eliminates the need for multiple "follow" actions for each friend on a remote server and replaces that with a one-time identity-verification action.
